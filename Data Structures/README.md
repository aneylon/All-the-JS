# General CS Concepts
Not particular to any programing language. These concepts are important for any programmer to understand.

## Data Structures
There are many, many data structures.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

Here are some important ones to know:
### Stacks
### Queues
### Linked Lists
### Hash Tables
### Trees
### Binary Search Trees
### Sets
### Graphs
### Heap

## Sorting
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm
### Bubble Sort
### Merge Sort
### Insertion Sort
### Selection Sort
### Quick Sort
### Heap Sort

## Search
### Breadth First Search
### Depth First Search

## Time Complexity
O(1) - Constant Time
Always takes the same amount of Time
Ex: accessing the key of an object
O(n) - Linear Time
Time increases exactly the same amount as the size of the input grows
Ex: Loop traversal of a list
O(log n) - Logarithmic
Each iteration halves the data set so time increases slowly for larger inputs
Ex: Binary Search

O(n^2) - Quadradic
O(n^c) - Polynomial
O(c^n) - Exponential

## Space Complexity
